Project web site: http://www.moosefs.com/

Installation and using MooseFS: http://www.moosefs.com/pages/userguides

Installation and using Keepalive：http://www.keepalived.org/

to use master ha， the master.cfg should add as follow:

as master: 
MASTER_HOST = slaveip //master ip when is slave, no use for master 
MASTER_STATE = 1 //means master 
SLA_SYNC_WORKER_HOST_1 = slaveip //slave ip, always same as MASTER_HOST
SLA_SYNC_WORKER_PORT_1 = slaveport //slave port 
SYNC_WORKER_HOST_1 = shadowip //shadow master 1 ip 
SYNC_WORKER_PORT_1 = slaveport //shadow master port 
VIRTUAL_IP = vip //vip for keepalive 
LOG_PATH = LOGPATH //log path 
CHUNK_HLIST_SIZE = NUM //chunk hlist for chunkserver manage in master

as slave different with master as follow: 
MASTER_STATE = 0 
MASTER_HOST = masterip 
SLA_SYNC_WORKER_HOST_1 = masterip
SYNC_THREAD_LISTEN_PORT = slaveport//which is same as SLA_SYNC_WORKER_HOST_1

using keepalive: master keepalive prority should bigger than slave，you should also assign the vip same as master.cfg
